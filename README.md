# SkedplusPairing [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ryanburnette/skedplus_pairing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ryanburnette/skedplus_pairing)

The goal of this project was to receive a text version of a pairing from
SkedPlus+, parse it, and return a useful structured object.

I never completed development and no longer have a need for it, but it's
here and open source in case anyone wants to continue development.
